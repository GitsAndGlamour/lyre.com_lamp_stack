**Project Lyre** is an open-source social network for discovering new online courses across the web.
(Under development) The foundation of the website is built upon an existing social network that exists as a customizable workplace communication web application.

## Brand

![logo](lyre-logo.png)
Lyre comes from the ground-dwelling Australian bird species that is most notable for their superb ability to imitate natural and artificial sounds from their environment. Shaped like the ancient Greek musical instrument, Lyre, the Lyrebird is the perfect reference to Lyre.com as it is unmatched in repertoire and retention of the environment. 

## Idea

**Project Lyre** allows users to search and filter online courses from across the web in one place in order to minimize time spent searching for courses, and increase the chances of finding the right course. With rating and reviews, finding the right online course becomes easier.

## Stack

**Project Lyre** is built using the LAMP stack which is centered around JavaScript. Other components included in the development phase of this project are:

1. [Laravel PHP MVC Framework](http://laravel.com)
2. [Bootstrap](http://getboostrap.com)

## Contribution

Because this is an academic project, I will not be allowing contributions and will hurriedly be working on this by myself as there is a due date. After I've finished the 1.0 version, this project will become an open-source project and anyone should feel free and welcome to contact me about contributions on either my GitHub account [GitsAndGlamour](http://github.com/gitsandglamour) or my personal site [omiewalls.com](http://omiewalls.com/#/contact).

When the repository is open for contributions, please check the issues section for details about what you can pick and choose to contribute towards. 

## Background

**Project Lyre** is being developed by [@omiewalls](http://twitter.com/@omiewalls) as an academic project. There are other versions being made, one under the MEAN stack, LAMP stack (with Angular for routing), and lastly one using Java under the Android SDK.
